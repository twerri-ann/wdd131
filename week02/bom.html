            <h2>Helaman 5:12 </h2>
            <p>"And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye
            must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind,
            yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the
            gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation
            whereon if men build they cannot fall."</p>

            <h2>Ether 12:4</h2>
            <p>Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the
                right hand of God,
                which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would make them sure and
                steadfast, always
                abounding in good works, being led to glorify God.</p>
