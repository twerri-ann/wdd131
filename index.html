            <img src="images/maypen.jpg" alt="May Pen, Clarendon, Jamaica">
            <p>Clarendon is a parish located on the southern coast of Jamaica. Known for its agricultural landscape,
                it's often referred to as the "breadbasket" of the island due to its vast production of crops like
                sugarcane, bananas, and coconuts. The parish is also rich in history and culture, with attractions such
                as the historical town of May Pen, the capital, and beautiful natural sites like the Milk River Baths, a
                popular mineral spring resort. Clarendon offers a blend of rural charm and local traditions, making it a
                unique part of Jamaica’s cultural and economic landscape.</p>
